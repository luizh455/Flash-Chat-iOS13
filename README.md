## Our Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

## What I've created

By the end of this project, I've got a fully functional app similar to Whatsapp. I've used the Firebase service with Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve the messages in real-time.
